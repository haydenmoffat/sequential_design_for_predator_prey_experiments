# sequential_design_for_predator_prey_experiments
This repository contains R and MATLAB code that conducts optimal sequential experimental design for predator-prey experiments. This code considers optimal designs for the purpose of precise parameter estimation and/or model discrimination. However, the user is free to define their own experimental goal. The code is commented and a brief description of how to use the code is included.
